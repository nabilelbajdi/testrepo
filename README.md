# Test repository for building pipelines and GitLab mirroring

- Test 1: This message should show in GitLab (editing README file in Develop branch)
- Test 2: Checking to see if this shows in GitLab (probably wont, because it tells me I need to use git fetch in the github workflow. right now, i can only implement changes by creating a new branch and merging it into develop. cannot make changes directly in develop)
